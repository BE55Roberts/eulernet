Project Euler examples

Project Euler is a set of mathematical computing problems that honor the mathematician Leonhard Euler. These files are my efforts to solve some of these problems, along with musings about them. They are only examples of various problem solving strategies and tactics.

# TRIALS
Each attempt at a solution is labeled a trial, where the problem number follows the term "trial" in the file name. 
Most of these have defaults for the problem at hand. 
However, all respond to a "-h" flag to show various options and details.
